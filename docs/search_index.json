(5%) Consider \\(f: S \\subset \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\), where \\(S\\) is an open set in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Assume that \\(f\\) is continuous at a point \\(c\\) in \\(S\\) and that \\(f(c) &gt; 0\\). Prove that there exists an open set \\(U \\subset S\\), such that for all \\(x \\in U\\), \\(f(x) &gt; 0\\). Proof. Because \\(f(c)\\) is an interior point of \\((0, \\infty)\\), there exists a \\(\\delta &gt; 0\\) such that \\[\\begin{align} B\\left(f(c), \\delta \\right) \\subset (0, \\infty). \\end{align}\\] Because \\(B\\left(f(c), \\delta \\right)\\) is an open set in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), its inverse image \\(f^{-1}\\left( B\\left(f(c), \\delta\\right) \\right)\\) is open in \\(S\\).

We want to show that we can find a convergent subsequence of \\(\\{ z_n \\}\\) such that its limit \\(z\\) is in \\(S_1 + S_2\\). Because \\(z_n \\in S_1+S_2\\), this implies that we can find a point \\(x_n \\in S_1\\) and \\(y_n \\in S_2\\) such that \\(z_n = x_n + y_n\\). Because \\(S_1\\) is compact, and \\(\\{x_n\\}\\) is a sequence in \\(S_1\\), we can find a convergent subsequence of \\(\\{x_n\\}\\), denoted by \\(\\{x_{k(n)} \\}\\) such that \\[\\begin{align} \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} x_{k(n)}=x \\in S_1. \\end{align}\\] Because \\(S_2\\) is compact, and \\(\\{ y_n \\}\\) is a sequence in \\(S_2\\), this implies that its subsequence \\(\\{y_{k(n)} \\}\\) converges to a point \\(y \\in S_2\\). Therefore, we find a subsequence \\(\\{z_{k(n)} \\}\\) converges to \\(z = x + y\\), and \\(z \\in S_1+S_2\\), which completes that proof that \\(S_1+S_2\\) is compact.

Solution (b) (5%) The statement Because \\(S_2\\) is compact, and \\(\\{ y_n \\}\\) is a sequence in \\(S_2\\), this implies that its subsequence \\(\\{y_{k(n)} \\}\\) converges to a point \\(y \\in S_2\\). is wrong.
